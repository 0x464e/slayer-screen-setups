# Slayer Screen Setups
An AHK script to conveniently and easily switch screen setups <sup><sub>(along with some misc extras)</sub></sup>.

This is not usable (at least directly) for anyone but me, but I've had questions about the code so here it is.  
Feel free to take any inspiration for creating your script.
